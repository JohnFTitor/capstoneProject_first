# CC Bootcamp Summer 2022 Landing Page

### Prerequisites

You need to make sure to have installed the latest version of Node.js and npm on your computer in order to run Sass if you want to contribute to the project or easily work on it, since working in the CSS alone may be a little to overwhelming compared to the Sass modular structure

### Setup

You can clone this repository or simply download the files as a .zip
If you want to set up a personal repository based on this one, you can as well fork it.

### Install

#### If you want to use Sass

After clone it and before working on it, follow these install instructions:

Run the following command to install node-sass as a dev dependecy in the root of the project 

```npm install node-sass --save-dev```

No need to initialize your npm because a package.json file is provided within the project

After that, you can use the scripts defined in the package.json file. 

```npm run watch-sass``` - To automatically compile the css file whenever the main.scss file is modified

```npm run compile-sass``` - To manualy compile the css file with the main.scss file changes
